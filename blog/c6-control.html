          <h2 class="text">What learnings did I take form this chapter?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            I learned about how to react to my triggers. I can have a hot and explosive temper. I have learned over the years to control it to some degree, meaning I can remain calm in most distressing situations but from time to time, when the stress gets too much, or a particular trigger is pulled, my anger can explode outwards uncontrollably. Just this weekend, a situation occurred in which I was triggered to respond in anger. This chapter built on the previous chapter's insight that anger is but a physiological feeling and not an ontological state by adding ways of dealing with triggers. I liked the process of the North SiBerian Rail Road. I think the sacred pause is very important for maintaining control in the face of triggers. It is something I intend to practice.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text">How did I find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            I recalled the situation in the weekend when I had lost my temper. I tried to recall the emotions felt. The hardest part was thinking of a better response. Every time I thought of a kinder response, I welled up with anger again. In the end, I addressed what had caused the other person to react in the way that had set off a trigger in me. I realised that an earlier reaction of mine had caused the response that had triggered me. In dealing with that reaction, I was able to see the other person's response in a more understanding light. I now feel I could face that situation differently in the future.
