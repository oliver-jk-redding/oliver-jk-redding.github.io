            In my podcast this morning it talked about cognitive biases and how these can affect the way we make judgements and decisions. Although I was already aware of the existence of these it is a topic I found really interesting to revisit. I went to wikipedia which has a list of common cognitive biases. Here are a few from that list:
          </p>
          <ul class="side-menu" style="font-size:1em;">
            <li><strong>Unit bias: </strong>The tendency to want to finish a given unit of a task or an item. Strong effects on the consumption of food in particular.</li>
            <li><strong>Bandwagon effect: </strong>The tendency to do (or believe) things because many other people do (or believe) the same. Related to groupthink and herd behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimism/Pessimism Bias: </strong>The tendency to overestimate pleasing or negative outcomes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I find these biases fascinating as they can so easily affect our thinking without us necessarily even realising it. It is important I think to be aware of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what are some examples in my life when I have been affected by the above four biases?
            I can definitely relate to the Unit Bias. I hate leaving things unfinished. Whether it be the food in front of me, a particular task I've started on, a book or a TV show, I don't like to leave them unfinished, even if I am not enjoying them very much. I've slogged through a number of books and TV shows for no better reason that 'I've started it, so I need to finish it.' How much time do we waste finishing things for no other reason than we started them? Don't get me wrong, I think it's important to finish things that have a good productive outcome. But one has to draw the distinction between things that are worth finishing or important to finish, and things that are not worth it but we finish anyway just for the sake of finishing. This is one to bear in mind. Next time I find myself not enjoying a particular book, I will can it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bandwagon effect I see all the time, especially on facebook. An example would be after the recent Paris attacks when everyone changed their profile pic to have a French flag overlay. The thing that annoyed me and others about this action is that it betrayed a deep European bias, to favour a tragedy in Europe over one elsewhere. Around the same time as the attacks in Paris for example, an attack in Libya occurred with far less media coverage. This is perhaps less a European bias than it is a tribal bias. We have a great tendency to associate and empathise with events in our own tribe. Being a western country, we very quickly related to the events in France over the events in Libya.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to the third bias, I am definitely guilty of being overly optimistic. I often downplay potentially negative outcomes believing the outcome will be favourable. This habit has often made me late to things because I believe the traffic will not be as bad as it is for example. Or I set out to do more in my day than actually gets done. By contrast, my wife is more prone to pessimism bias and tends to stress over imagined terrible outcomes that often never eventuate. This leads me to find her too negative at times, but I'm sure I equally frustrate her as being too wishful or idealistic. As frustrating as it can be, we complement each other as I will encourage her to do things she might otherwise be afraid to try, while she reminds me of things to watch out for and keeps me wary of pitfalls.

            In what ways are you affected by or in what ways do you see the effects of cognitive biases in your life?
