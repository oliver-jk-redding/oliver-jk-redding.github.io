    <h1>Reflection on Shereef's Fireside Chat</h1>
    <h2>What's my take on the DBC/EDA experience and what are my impressions?</h2>

    <p>
      It seems that EDA wants to change the game in terms of how code is taught and learnt.  The emphasis is placed on the learner to direct and drive their own learning and development rather than the teacher to bestow knowledge.  It is less about a teacher-student relationship than it is a discoverer-guide experience.  This is congruent with the latest pegagogy techniques and is an emphasis I have seen talked about in teaching circles.  This is probably the most enthusiastic embrace of these new techniques and principles that I have seen, however. I look forward to seeing how this approach to learning bears out in practice by diving in and experiencing it first hand.

    <h2>How do I see myself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>

     Unfortuanately, a few weeks ago, she injured her leg. She had to undergo surgery to get better, and is currently recovering at home. She is not allowed to run or jump lest she undo the work done during surgery. This makes Annie miserable because she cannot run and hide when she gets scared.

      Annie likes to eat biscuits. Recently we had to start giving her green biscuits to help with her breath which stinks. She doesn't seem to mind though.
