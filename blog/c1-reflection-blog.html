    <h1>Reflection on Shereef's Fireside Chat</h1>
    <h2>What's my take on the DBC/EDA experience and what are my impressions?</h2>
    <h3>07 December 2015</h3>
    
    <p>
      It seems that EDA wants to change the game in terms of how code is taught and learnt.  The emphasis is placed on the learner to direct and drive their own learning and development rather than the teacher to bestow knowledge.  It is less about a teacher-student relationship than it is a discoverer-guide experience.  This is congruent with the latest pegagogy techniques and is an emphasis I have seen talked about in teaching circles.  This is probably the most enthusiastic embrace of these new techniques and principles that I have seen, however. I look forward to seeing how this approach to learning bears out in practice by diving in and experiencing it first hand.

    <h2>How do I see myself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
    <h3>07 December 2015</h3>

    <p>
     On the one hand, I think EDA's approach to learning will challenge me in many ways.  As a teacher, I have some fairly ingrained ideas about how teaching and learning should happen. EDA takes a very different approach to my own pedagogical practice.  On the other hand, their apporach is not alien to me as I have seen it talked about as part of my professional development.  I look forward to engaging with this new style of learning.  I have always been a self-motivated learner and look forward to taking on this challenge.  I think, therefore, I will engage with EDA's culture with enthusiasm.

    <h2>How have my expectations of EDA changed and if so how?</h2>
    <h3>07 December 2015</h3>

    <p>
      I didn't expect the programme to be so full-on so quickly.  I was stunned with the workload in the first week.  I didn't expect this course to be easy, but I did not perhaps fully appreciate what it would demand of me.  Shereef talked about how the 90% employment rate after graduation is not to be comforting because the people that get jobs get them through hard work, grit and determination.  This really sunk home the need to not get complacent.  I will have my work cut out for me!
