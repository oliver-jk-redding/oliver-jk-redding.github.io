            <li>
              <h5>parentheses():</h5> 
              <p>
                1. These are like a green light to a method or function to run. When you put these after a function the function will activate. Sometimes functions need an important piece of information to run, like a car needs a key. If you put anything inbeween the parentheses, the function will use that information as the key.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Parentheses can also be used in a function's description to receive important information necessary for that function to run. If, say the function is going to move a car, it needs to know which car to move. The parentheses will receive that information and pass it on to the rest of the function.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Parentheses can also take an equation to check to make something else happen. This is the case for 'if', 'for', and 'while' expressions. The parentheses contain the information to check to see what instruction needs to be carried out.
              </p>
              <p>
                4. Finally parentheses can be used as they would in ordinary mathematics equations as part of the BEDMAS formula.I have used this before during my java papers at uni and so I feel reasonably confident using it. However, I haven't gotten very effective at using it to solve problems as I have not yet greatly felt the need of it. I tend to be able to think about what comes next, coding as I go. When I encounter problems, I am usually pretty good at using other techniques to solve them. The closest I come to using pseudocode is when I am coding a function, and I want to call a method to do a particular action within that function that hasn't been defined yet. I will usually just write a call to that method as though the method had been defined e.g. 'startNewGame()', finish coding my function, and then go and code that method. Perhaps as I get into more complex code I will start using pseudocode more. It is a practice I intend on experimenting with more.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>brackets[]:</h5> 
              <p>              
                1. These are used to create an array. When an array is created they define what the array is holding. Kind of like if you making a train, the brackets define what goes in each carriage.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Brackets can also be used after an array is referred to in an expression to define what piece of information to access. Using the train analogy, if I wanted to repaint carriage 5, the brackets would be used to fetch it.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Brackets can also be used to name an object's properties in a style called 'square bracket notation'. This is kind of like a file of information containing the colour of an object.
              </p>              
            </li>            
            <li>
              <h5>braces{}:</h5>
              <p>                
                1. These are used to announce the start and end of a function's description, kind of like bookends on a shelf. All the information between the bookends is information that the function uses to run.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Brackets can also be used to bookend a block of code that will only be run if a condition is met. This stops it from being run automatically.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>single quotes '':</h5>
              <p>
                1. These are used to contain a string. A string is a series of words. An analogy would be if I wanted to quote someone, I would use quotation marks to signal the start and end of the quote. In javascript, these work in exactly the same way except that they don't just contain quotes; they can contain any series of words that we want the computer to understand as text, not code.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. In a similar way to the above, single quotes can also be used to define names of objects. E.g. if I wanted to name ann object 'dog', I would contain it in quotes. This signifies to the computer where the object name begins and ends.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h5>double quotes "":</h5>
              <p>
                1. These are used in exactly the same way as single quotes. They are somewhat more common than single quotes, however. One difference between them is if a string starts with one type of quotes and within that string we want to contain a quote or another string, we would need to use the other type of quotation marks so the computer doesn't cut us off mid-sentence. E.g. if my string was "It was Homer who said, 'This is the story of the arms and the man.'", I would need to use different types of quotes for the quote and the string. 
              </p>
