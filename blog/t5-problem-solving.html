          <h2 class="text">What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            The two are very similar. Mindfulness involves being mindful of oneself in a particular moment, while self-awareness is maintaining mindfulness in the midst of emotions. Both involve being aware of what one is feeling and experiencing at a particular point in time. Mindfulness is perhaps somewhat broader in definition though in that it involves not just being aware of one's emotional state, but bringing focus to outside phenomena as well including the emotional states of others. It is important therefore to have mindfulness in order to have self-awareness.

          <h2 class="text">What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not me" section?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            This resonated with me quite strongly as I had only an hour before had an argument with my wife. During a pause in the argument, I sat thinking of the next angry response I could give, but then suddenly became aware I was angry. I realised in that moment that anger was just an emotion and could be controlled. I thought, I don't like being angry with my wife and it would be nice to return to a state of not being angry with her. So I resolved to dismiss my anger. But it was not so easily done. I still felt mad about what she had done. Further to that, I felt annoyed about me having to be the one to dismiss my anger and not her. I knew she would still be mad at me. I thought "why do I have to control my emotions when she doesn't?" I then thought "if I dismiss my anger now, should I always dismiss it? Should I never allow myself to become or stay angry?" I didn't like that thought very much as there are times when I see injustice being done and I don't respond because I can be quite calm and slow to anger and then I walk away thinking "I wish I had gotten angry and responded to that." I came then to another insight. Anger is not in itself a bad emotion. It has a place and a purpose. Biologically, that purpose was to help us survive, to help us fight competitors. In today's world it can help us to set wrongs aright and fight injustice. Not that my wife was being unjust in that sense. But I resolved that my anger had a place and a right to be felt. What mattered was not dismissing it, but being mindful of it and in control of it. I didn't make an angry response to further inflame the situation. I was still mad, but I resolved to control that anger, feel it, be mindful of it, and let it pass in its own time. In the next half hour, my anger had passed, so had my wife's, and we both moved on with our lives.
