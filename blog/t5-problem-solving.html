          <h2 class="text">Overcoming Problems in Code</h2>      
          <p class="text">
            During the coding of my racing game I encountered a number of problems with my code. I find problems can usually fall into two main categories:
          </p>
          <ul class="side-menu" style="font-size:1em;">
            <li>
              <strong>Syntax errors:</strong> These are problems in the actual grammar of your code e.g. putting a semi-colon in the wrong place or forgetting to use a capital letter. These errors can actually make the code unreadable for your computer, stopping the whole website from working, but are usually easy to solve.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Logic errors:</strong> These are problems to do with the output of your code. The code might be grammatically correct and make sense to the computer, but the code produces an outcome different to the one you were expecting. This is usually because you wrote the code to achieve a particular outcome, but didn't follow through the logic properly and so the outcome is actually different to what you prepared for. These can be harder to detect and fix.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If I encounter an error in my code, the first thing I do is look for error messages in the console. This can resolve the issue quickly as the console will usually show the line of code it is getting stuck on and tell you which line in the document it is. This can be particularly effective for solving syntax errors, for example finding that extra closing bracket you forgot to delete. It can also solve some logic errors, for example it might be that a particular variable has been undefined and the console can quickly identify which variable that is.
          </p>
          <p>
            If that doesn't solve it, things can take a bit longer. It's time to isolate the problem. I add console.log() statements at various key points throughout the code to check that the program is reaching a desired section of code and that the values are as expected. A console.log() statement is a line of code that tells the program to print a specified output. This is especially useful with condition statements. Sometimes if a condition looks like it is being met, but the action in that condition is not happening, it can be useful to stick in a console.log() statement to see if the problem is with the action code or the condition code. If the console.log() statement fails to fire, then I know the problem is with the condition, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Console.log statements can also be useful to check variables have the expected values. I might think a particular variable has the value '6' but in fact it has a value of '0'. Console.log() statements can quickly identify such problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another trick is to 'comment' sections of more complex code and try running the program with more simplified code. E.g. if I can't get a function like checkKeyPressed() to fire off another complex function, updatePlayerPosition(), I need to know if the problem is with the checkKeyPressed() function or the updatePlayerPosition() function. So I will 'comment' or deactivate the checkKeyPressed() function and write a simpler version that instead of firing another function, does nothing more complicated than logging the key pressed to the console. Depending on the result I will know in which function the problem lies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes the problem lies just with me not knowing the right code in which case I will comb google, w3schools, stackoverflow, and other useful sites to look for the right code or the correct way to implement that code. I'll often steal lines of code from these sites and paste it into my own code then modify it to suit my needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a nutshell that's what I do. I have learned that working on a tired brain doesn't help either. The other night I was up until 1am trying to solve a problem which was as simple as writing 'keyCode' with a capital 'C' instead of a little 'c'.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is worth having these techniques. There are few things more satisfying than finally solving a complex and frustrating problem and seeing your project advance to the next step.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text">How I confident I feel about using the following techniques:</h2>
          <ul class="side-menu" style="font-size:1em;">
            <li>
              <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I have used this before during my java papers at uni and so I feel reasonably confident using it. However, I haven't gotten very effective at using it to solve problems as I have not yet greatly felt the need of it. I tend to be able to think about what comes next, coding as I go. When I encounter problems, I am usually pretty good at using other techniques to solve them. The closest I come to using pseudocode is when I am coding a function, and I want to call a method to do a particular action within that function that hasn't been defined yet. I will usually just write a call to that method as though the method had been defined e.g. 'startNewGame()', finish coding my function, and then go and code that method. Perhaps as I get into more complex code I will start using pseudocode more. It is a practice I intend on experimenting with more.
            </li>
            <li>            
              <strong>Trying something:</strong> During problem solving I will often try many different iterations of code to try to produce the desired result. If I find a particular stretch of code is not getting the result I want, I will break that code into smaller, simpler sections and try running each of those to get lots of little successful results. Then I will put it back together again. Sometimes if I get code I do not understand from the internet, but I find it works in my program, I will fiddle around with variables and arguments to try to understand the code. During my programming a lot of time is spent trying out bits of code that won't necessarily be included in the final program but which help to understand the code and build up to the desired result.
            </li>            
            <li>
              <strong>Rubber Ducky method:</strong> I'm not sure I would feel very confident actually talking to a rubber ducky but the principle behind it of talking through a problem out loud is a good one, and one I employ from time to time. I often find it helps to draw the process on paper as I speak to assist with visualisation. This can be very useful.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reading error messages:</strong> This is something I find pretty confident doing as I once wrote a program in java and error messages were my friend in solving problems for that. During that project, I got used to reading and interpreting complex console feeds in the program 'Eclipse'. The chrome console is similar. I understand where to look and how to find the error. The next step is to understand other places error messages can be logged. I believe good programs are written with plenty of console commands that define specific errors. And I believe there are other programs built for receiving and displaying errors. I would like to get more familiar with these and other methods for logging error feeds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Console logging:</strong> I am very confident with this. I often use this technique to check if the program is reaching specific sections of code (especially useful for conditions) and to check if a specific variable has the value I expect it to have.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Googling:</strong> I am very confident with this as well. If I simply do not know the code required, I will often go to google with a request like 'how to access event value javascript'. I think I am good at defining what I want with keywords and often arrive at potential solutions quickly. The difficulty can be finding a simple solution. Sometimes the solutions out there use far more complex code than is necessary. At other times, I do not understand the solution so I might have to fiddle around with it in my own code first. The trickiest thing of all is when a solution works within a particular context but does not work in my context (particularly true with CSS). I sometimes just have to search around for solutions related to my context in that case. I usually stick to w3schools or language documentation when I can as these are usually the simplest and clearest, but stackoverflow can be very good as well. One thing I have not done yet, but I should try, is actually engaging online people for help e.g. by posting my own problems to stackoverflow. There is usually no need though as in almost every case, the problems I have, someone else has had first.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Asking peers for help:</strong> I am getting better at this but traditionally have been very poor at this. I don't like to ask people for help. I don't mind searching for solutions on google, but I like to solve the problems on my own, not by asking someone else. Recently I got so stuck though that I did ask for help and got a quick and useful reply. I will have to try this more often!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> Actually this was what I did when I got really stuck in the scenario mentioned above. But it was not a coach who answered; it was a peer. The coaches are of course very knowledgeable but they are also few. I have found my peer group more effective for getting quick replies. Sometimes the coaches don't respond for a while or at all. I do not blame them. They have a lot to do. But I am beginning to realise they are better as a secondary resort. My peers should be my first resort.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Improving my process with reflection:</strong> I don't know the extent to which my process has been improved by reflection. I am a naturally self-reflective person and often am not conscious of my self-reflection going on, so if my process does improve as a result, I probably won't notice it. Most of my self-reflection is mental, and I rarely write it down unless instructed to like in this course. Writing it down can be good for coming to new insights, but it is diffult to pinpoint at this time tangible ways in which my process has improved as a result of it. Perhaps it has, but I am not aware.
            </li>
          </ul>          
          <h2 class="text">Some functions and what they do</h2>
          <ul class="side-menu" style="font-size:1em;">
            <li>
              <strong>.map():</strong> This is a method that can be called on an array. An array is a collection of objects. Array methods like .map() are actions that can be activated on the objects in the array. They are methods linked to all arrays so all arrays can make use of them. What do you do however if you want to call a method on an array that is not an array-specific method? e.g. a method you have defined yourself? The .map() method can come in handy here. The .map() method allows functions from outside the array's list of linked functions to be called on the array. By including a function as an argument in the .map() function, you will call that function on the elements in the array. E.g. array.map(Math.sqrt) will call the .sqrt() function on all the elements in the array. If the array consists of a list of numbers, the new array will have all the square roots of those numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>.filter():</strong> The .filter() method is another special array method. Think of this scenario: If you have an array with a collection of numbers, but you want to only keep the numbers above 5, there are two ways you could do this. First you would want to make a function that checks whether or not a number is greater than 5. This is called a 'test'. The first way would be to call that function on each element individually, check if that element passed the test, i.e. was greater than 5, and then save that element individually to the new array. The .map() method could help you here by allowing you to call the test on all elements simultaneously, but you would still have to check individually whether each element passed the test and should be saved to the new array. A second and faster approach would be to use the .filter() method. This method allows you to call a test on each element in the specified array by supplying a test as an argument in the method. This is similar to the .map() method but the .filter() method goes further in that it not only calls the method on each element but also automatically checks whether each element passes the test and saves it to the new array. The .filter() method is therefore an effective way to quickly filter an array into a smaller collection of values that meet specific criteria.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>.reduce():</strong> The purpose of the .reduce() method is to reduce all the numbers in an array of numbers to a single value. This is done by providing a function as an argument to the .reduce() method, the function specificing what equation should be carried out upon each number in the array. The equation specified in the function is carried out for each element against the previous element so that a value accumulates until all elements have been processed and a single value remains, the accumulation of all the values in the array. In this way an array is reduced to one value. An example would be array of <code>[0,1,2,3]</code>. If this array were reduced with an equation of <code>a+b</code> i.e. the current value + the previous value, the process would go something like 'current sum value + next value = new sum value' or <code>0+1=1, 1+2=3, 2+3=6</code>. The final value, in this case, after all previous values had been accumulated, would be '6' so the reduced value of the array would be '6'.
