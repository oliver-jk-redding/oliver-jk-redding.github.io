          <h2 class="text">Which timebox and habits techniques did I try?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            I tried to timebox the time I spent reading the reflection resources and the Time Management resources. I am currently putting into practice the Pomodoro technique, by trying to stay focused and productive for 25 minute blocks.  I resisted the temtation to check email and facebook.  I am hoping by these practices to get closer to achieving a flow state.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text">What Did I Find Interesting?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            I found the theory around the state of flow concept very interesting.  I have experienced this before, but it is now my intention to become more focused and achieve this on a more regular basis. I thrive in finding my state of flow.  It is something I was rarely able to achieve as a teacher as teaching is full of interruptions.  I had not even realised this was frustrating me.  I realise now it was one of the main motivations for me wanting to get out of teaching.  I am looking forward to entering a job space where hopefully I can achieve a state of flow more regularly.  The techniques around timeboxing and time management were also interesting. I am hoping to put some of these into practice to increase my productivity.  Time is very precious to me and I look forward to saving more of it in future!
          </p>
          <h2 class="text">What worked for me?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Timeboxing definitely helped me focus.  Knowing I am on the clock, helped me to cut out time-wasting distractions.  It helped me to focus on my outcomes. One change I noticed was that I was able to skim read more effectively.  Usually, when I attempt to skim read, I either get bogged down in text, or skim through without taking in the content.  Using techniques like timeboxing I was able to enhance my skim reading abilities by reading quickly and taking in content at the same time.   
          </p>
          <h2 class="text">Which will I experiment further with?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            I am keen to experiment further with the timeboxing technique.  I am especially interested in the pamodoro technique.  I want to use it to estimate time to finish tasks and try to keep to that estimation.  I want to be more goal-oriented in my work.  I want to set goals each day and with each task, and try to achieve those.  Getting the most out of time is vital to success.
