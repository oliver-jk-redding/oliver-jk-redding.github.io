          <h2 class="text"> What is my experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            To bosses stand out in my life. Both were effective in their own way, but one was far better liked than the other and would easily get the vote for being the better boss. The well-liked boss had the great ability to engage with you and get on your level. She was never condescending; you felt she understood you and wanted you to achieve your best. The other leader had limited engagement. You felt that her primary concerns were herself and the company, and you were secondary to that. As a result, people resented and resisted this boss, whereas they would go the second mile for the well-liked boss. It is obvious that the well-liked boss had compassion, whereas the other one had it to a lesser degree.

          <h2 class="text">Multiplying Goodness Meditation</h2>
          <p>
            Doing this meditation filled me with a sense of calm and happiness.
          </p>    
          <h2 class="text">Tonglen Meditation</h2>
          <p>
            I can't say I really transformed suffering into happiness. I was able to feel happy and calm like in the prior meditation exercise, but when I thought of the things that made me unhappy, they made me unhappy again. It felt inauthentic doing this on the behalf of others. This is good for transforming feelings of unhappiness but it doesn't transform the source of the unhappiness. When the source of the unhappiness is encountered again, it will still make me unhappy. Therefore I found this meditation exercise to be just a temporary fix.

          <h2 class="text">How does the SCARF model apply to my phase-0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            <strong>Status: </strong>As a cohort, we have and will be progressing through the course socially. Status will be a factor in the way relationships are formed as there will be those who will strive to have greater status than others. This could encourage competition and growth but could also foster rivalry and envy. I think in Phase-0 we have seen positive examples of this where people have encouraged others to strive to do better e.g. in the racer game challenge. I hope that status will continue to grow our group positively in the bootcamp to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Certainty: </strong>Many of us have a sense of uncertainty about the course. We have left our jobs to do this and there is the risk it might not work out. This uncertainty has driven us to work hard during Phase-0 and will continue to drive us to work hard during bootcamp as the stakes are very high and many of us need this to work out.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Autonomy: </strong>Phase-0 has given us plenty of autonomy to explore our own learning. I think this has helped to make it a positive learning environment. I hope that we will continue to have a positive experience during Bootcamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Relatedness: </strong>We all want to relate well with other and make friends. I think this has showed in our kind nature towards one another so far during Phase-0 and hopefully will continue to do so in Bootcamp. In fact, with us able to be physically close to one another, hopefully it will foster better relationships.
          </p>  
          <p>
            <strong>Fairness: </strong>I don't think this aspect of our social brain has had a big impact on us yet in Phase-0. It may do so in Bootcamp where people may feel lack of fairness if others are seen to be getting greater attention from the tutors. I doubt this will be the case though.
          </p> 
          <h2 class="text">A Difficult Conversation</h2>
          <h5>My Version:</h5>
          <p class="text">
            <strong>Content Conversation: </strong> I said I thought it would be better that if he had an issue with our supervisor, that he raise the issue with the supervisor privately, rather than copy everyone else in on the email. I said I didn't think it was appropriate to make the conversation so public.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Feelings Conversation: </strong>There was tension. Frustration on his end over the supervisor and the fact that I, a newer member of staff was telling him how he should be acting.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Identity Conversation: </strong>I felt that he was the lesser person in this conversation for acting inappropriately. I felt he had breached professional conduct. I felt I had the moral high ground.
          </p>
          <h5>Other Version:</h5>
          <p class="text">
            <strong>Content Conversation: </strong> He told me that I shouldn't copy everyone in when I raise something with my supervisor. I responded that there is an issue at stake here and that as a democratic society we should be able to discuss it openly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Feelings Conversation: </strong>I was annoyed at him coming to tell me off. Who does he think he is?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Identity Conversation: </strong>I was made to feel incompetent and unprofessional.
