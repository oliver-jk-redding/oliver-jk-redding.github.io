1) A responsive site is a website that responds to different screen sizes. It responds by rearranging or resizing the content to make it more visually effective at specific screen sizes. This is important because a website that looks good on one screen size might not look good on another, but by using responsive design, you can make sure the key information is conveyed in a visually effective way no matter what size the screen is.

2) Mobile first design is website design that prioritises mobile size screens. It does this by setting the default layout for a website to suit mobile screens, then using media queries to trigger layouts that suit larger size screens if the screen is larger than mobile size. This is an important design feature, because it increases performance for mobiles, which often have less processing power than larger devices, by saving them from parsing lots of unnecessary code.

3) Frameworks are lines of pre-written code that lay a foundation for a website by providing a basic layout. The website creator must add the content. Layouts are one of the hardest aspects of a website to code. Therefore a major pro of a framework is that it saves a website creator from coding this difficult part of a website. The creator can instead focus on making the content. Another pro is that frameworks are built to be highly adaptable so that the basic layout can easily be altered. Frameworks therefore save the website creator time in a flexible way.

A con of frameworks is that if used by a novice website developer they prevent the developer from learning how to code a layout for him/herself. If the developer does not have an understanding of coding layouts, frameworks can also be difficult to tamper with in a way that doesn't break the layout. This can compromise flexibility.

4) Wireframes are a basic sketh of a webpage's layout, including headings, text areas and pictures. We use wireframes as a planning tool to give us an idea of the basic layout of the page before we construct it. Sketching a wireframe also helps us conceptualise how we will go about coding the webpage.

5) The aspect of my wireframes I found most difficult was laying out the text where I planned it, especially getting it centered in the middle of the page. This difficulty particularly applied to the footer links which I wanted in the center of the page; it took a long time to get this to happen. The reason for this problem was because of the preset styles for containers, rows, and other elements, and it took a lot of fiddling and checking to figure out what styles needed to be overridden and how. Looking at other websites' code helped me.
