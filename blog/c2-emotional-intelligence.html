    <h2>What learnings did I take from the chapter?</h2>
    <h3>12 December 2015</h3>
    
    <p>
      I learned that one can train oneself to achieve more positive states of mind and that such states can affect one's leadership abilities and performance. I learned that through physiological actions one can one's psychological self.

    <h2>How did I find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
    <h3>12 December 2015</h3>

    <p>
      I found that I was able to slow down my heart rate and achieve a greater sense of calm.  I tried the 'easier' approach by just relaxing without an agenda. When I finished, I was able to return to my task with a greater sense of focus.  I think for best results, this could be combined with a brief walk outside to add fresh air to the activity.
