          <h2 class="text">How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            Looking through this lens, it becomes apparent what actions in my life bring me short term pleasure, and what activities bring me more sustained happiness as I undertake these activities with passion. The use of the words 'action' for pleasure, and 'activity' for passion are significant here. An action is something short term, almost instant, that is done and then it is over. Thus, the pleasure associated with them is also short term and over quickly. An activity, by contrast is something sustained and ongoing, thus bringing more sustained happiness such as flow. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Both actions and activities are temporary though. At some point activities also come to an end. I think happiness from higher purpose derives not so much from an action or an activity but from a mindset and way of being. This is not something performed that is temporary but rather an ongoing and sustained mental state that transcends and permeates all we do. This is the most sustained form of happiness like an undercurrent in a river, flowing underneath all the waves and ripples and splashes. Extending this metaphor, I might say an activity or passion is like a wave carrying us forward but eventually coming to an end and needing a break before the next wave of passion. An action or pleasure is like a big splash. Big but brief. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to live my life with an undercurrent of higher purpose, successive waves of passion, that build up to occassional big splashes.
          </p>
          <h2 class="text">What are my core values?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            My core values are commitment, integrity, dedication, high standards, making a positive impact, social justice, fairness and equality, open-mindedness, instropection, recognition for merit and not simply loyalty, passion, having purpose.
          </p>   
          <h2 class="text">What do I stand for?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            I believe in being passionate about the work you do and not just doing it for the money but doing it for a higher purpose. For me, that higher purpose is having a positive impact on the world around me, and making people's lives better, easier or more enjoyable. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that when one makes a promise or commitment, they should keep to that promise or commitment with dedication and integrity. That means producing work on time and of high quality. It means communicating clearly and being open, honest, and trasparent about process. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in social justice, fairness and equality. I believe no person should be discriminated against by the colour of their skin, gender, sexual inclination, beliefs, ethnicity or otherwise. I believe in being open-minded and not shutting people down because they disagree with you or retreating from alternative beliefs because you find them scary or different. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in being introspective; that is being self-aware, being honest about one's own weaknesses and also one's strengths, knowing one's values and motivators, and seeking ways to improve. I believe in always learning. Never stop learning. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in challenging the status quo. I believe in taking risks and trying new things. I believe in being open to new approaches. I believe that people should be recognised for the work they do, not the hours they put in or the boots they lick.
          </p> 
          <h2 class="text">How did I find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            I was able to experience the feelings associated with those events in an experiential way rather than an existential way. I was able to place them aside. One thing I felt that helped with this was to consider these events as tiny moments in the entirety of my life. Doing this, enabled me to see the smallness of their impact and what mattered was the life as a whole not the individual moments in it.
