          <h2 class="text">Have I tried using any of the insights and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            I haven't had a chance to practice any of these recently as I am at home studying most of the day with little interaction with people other than my wife whom (I hope) trusts me already.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in the past I have tried some of these techniques. I have not done much of the dipping and looping stuff yet, but I like to ask probing questions about people to understand their lives and where they are coming from. I don't like to talk about me too much in a conversation with a stranger as it is often much more interesting hearing other people talk about themselves. I think this also shows interest and helps to foster trust. An example that demonstrates that people trusted me was when I worked as a teacher, I was asked to be the chair person of the staff association. This association helped to build staff culture and wellbeing, and I was responsible for representing the staff before the employer and negotiating staff contracts. I do not think I would have been chosen for this position if I was not trusted.

          <h2 class="text">How did I find the loving kindness meditation?</h2>
          <p class="text">
            This was good as there are a few people in my life whom I have harboured ill feelings towards for a while. I found that by doing this meditation I was able to place a different thought framework around this person, and felt many of my feelings of dislike dissipate.

          <h2 class="text">Political Awareness Meditation</h2>
          <p class="text">
            <strong>My version:</strong> At my old job I worked as part of a team. The team was run by a middle manager whom many viewed to be incompetent. Many of those who were in this camp had been there for many years and hearkened back to a previous leader who was very much liked and admired. They found, by comparison, many shortcomings with this manager, and one person in particular often tried to undermine this manager at meetings and with emails. The manager was such a nice guy that he only ever responded with gentleness and kindness. Meanwhile, the insubordinate staff member would continue to undermine him, thinking that he represented and had the support of the whole group. While he did indeed have the support of some members of the group, it was far fewer than he imagined.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was not blind to the manager's faults. I knew there were some areas in which he was not completely up to the mark. But I liked the manager personally, and, while he wasn't amazing, he wasn't terrible either. What I couldn't stand was this staff member's continued insubordination and disrespect of a genuinely nice guy. I felt that this staff member needed to realise that imperfect managers are a fact of many work places and one should just try to do the best work they can with how things are; it is not their place to try to undermine the manager at every turn just because they don't like the way they're doing things.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the staff member sent yet another disrespectful email to the manager, copying in the whole group, I replied back that I felt he should discuss his concerns privately with the manager rather than copying everyone in. This of course created a bit of hard feeling between us.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Other version: </strong> I feel that in order for a school to run effectively there needs to be effective leadership. An effective leader should set high standards that are black and white so the students know where they stand and the teachers know what to enfore. Us teachers need to be on the same page and deliver a clear and consistent message so the students know what the expectations are. When this doesn't happen, discipline breaks down, teachers struggle to enfore rules as it is not clear what the rules are and teachers often undermine each other because they have different ideas about the rules because they have not been made clear. This further confuses students and, worse, allows them to play teachers off of one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            I feel that this manager is inadequate for the job as he is failing to deliver the essential leadership required to manage these students. It is so important to get this right, that if need be, I will nudge the manager into articulating a clearer message and thinking about the things he has missed. I will also make it clear to his managers that he is doing an inadequate job and that I am having to step up to help him.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What I got from this activity: </strong>As the book on mindfulness said, an interesting insight in this activity is how very similar two opposing accounts can be. Both this other staff member and I agreed that the manager was not perfect and that the boys and teachers could do with some clearer guidance. What we disagreed on here was priorities. On the one hand, the other staff member valued the need for clear expectations above other things, and felt that when teachers and students weren't getting a clear message that he needed to intervene. On the other hand, I valued working as a team and respecting others over the need for clear and effective leadership and so felt at odds with this staff member when he took action that I viewed as disrespect and insubordination. It's not that either of us didn't value the things the other valued, but the priorities were different.
