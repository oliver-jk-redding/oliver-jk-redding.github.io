    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <h3>07 December 2015</h3>
    
    <p>
      Annie came into the family in January of 2015. She has ginger fur and is small for her age. She has a skittish nature. When guests come over, she can usually be found hiding under the couch or bed.

     Unfortuanately, a few weeks ago, she injured her leg. She had to undergo surgery to get better, and is currently recovering at home. She is not allowed to run or jump lest she undo the work done during surgery. This makes Annie miserable because she cannot run and hide when she gets scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie likes to eat biscuits. Recently we had to start giving her green biscuits to help with her breath which stinks. She doesn't seem to mind though.
